# 🔶 CLAUDE (Anthropic)
# ==========================================

# --- Authentication ---
# Anthropic API Key (Starts with sk-ant-...)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# --- Current Models: Claude 3.5 (State of the Art) ---

# Claude 3.5 Sonnet: The current industry standard for coding and reasoning.
# Outperforms previous Opus models while being faster and cheaper. (Highly Recommended)
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Claude 3.5 Haiku: The fastest model.
# Intelligence similar to Claude 3 Opus but at a fraction of the cost/speed.
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022

# --- Legacy / Specialized Models (Claude 3) ---

# Claude 3 Opus: Previous flagship. Very "literary" and capable, but generally 
# slower and more expensive than 3.5 Sonnet. Good for nuanced creative writing.
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229

# Claude 3 Haiku: Previous fast generation. Use only if you need extreme cost savings.
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-haiku-20240307

# --- Models ---
# --- Grok 2 (Latest Stable - Recommended) ---

# Grok 2 (1212): The latest stable release. Significantly smarter, better 
# reasoning, and more consistent than the initial Beta.
# GROK_MODEL=grok-2-1212

# Grok 2 Vision (1212): The multimodal version of Grok 2.
# Use this if you need to analyze images or visual inputs.
# GROK_MODEL=grok-2-vision-1212

# --- Legacy / Beta Models ---

# Grok Beta: The previous generation. Kept for compatibility, but 
# generally less capable than Grok 2.
# GROK_MODEL=grok-beta

# Gemini 2.0 Flash: The newest generation. Multimodal, extremely fast, 
# and features improved reasoning capabilities. Currently the SOTA preview.
#GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp

# --- Gemini 1.5 (Production / Stable) ---
# Gemini 1.5 Pro: The smartest model for complex reasoning, coding, and 
# deep analysis. Supports huge context windows (up to 2M tokens).
# GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro

# Gemini 1.5 Flash: The best balance between cost, speed, and intelligence.
# Recommended for most standard production applications.
